When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Whenn I want to share all my work with other users and I want them to contribute to make it better.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because if it pulls automatically it might interfere with my current work . It might make changes that I
don't want right now but later.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks is clone on github server. Clone duplicates a repository on your local system. Branches are
commits made on a non-linear flow.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It helps when the latest commit on github is not in sync with local version. When we want to push or
pull from or to github origin/master branch is merged with master branch of github and then local master
branch is merged to origin/master and any conflict if occurred is displayed.
