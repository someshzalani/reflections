What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?


.git file is created which contains the meta data about changes and information about versions.
To use git for a version control system we need to make a directory into git repository.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?

What value do you think it offers?


staging area contains what changes we have ye to commit to the repository. It helps us divide repository
into a number of commits.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?



After I make all the necessary changes in the working directory I will add the file which contains
one logical change to staging area and commit the changes with appropriate message. I can do that with
other files similarly.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? 
How would branches help?

If I want to add some feature in the application and I also want to retain the current version then
branches could help in a situation where I want to keep the old application live and also fix some
bugs which were there . This way we can add new feature in one branch and fix bugs in older version in 
another branch.



How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?



It shows the chain of commits in the branches help us find out till what point all branches were in a
single flow.

What is the result of merging two branches together?Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?


Merging two branches includes the changes done in both of the branches in the same branch.
the diagram differentiates the changes were made in two seperate branches and shows the merged commit
has two parents.


What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

auto merging helps us in a way that we don't have to compare the code and check which code to include 
or which to not. when a conflict occurs git asks us to solve the conflict manually which is good because
sometimes it is required to consult with the owner of the other branch that what changes are needed to
be kept.
